## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the five parts of a function definition?
The first part is the function keyword that begins the function. The second is the name of the function. The third are the parameters which are enclosed by parentheses and separated by commas. The fourth part is the opening curly bracket that starts the function's code block. The last part of the function is the return statement.
- How do you call a function?
You call a function by writing the name of the function that has already been defined and placing paretheses and then a semicolon. This causes the code block within the function to be executed.

A parameter is a placeholder whereas an argument is the values you provide or pass in to a function.
