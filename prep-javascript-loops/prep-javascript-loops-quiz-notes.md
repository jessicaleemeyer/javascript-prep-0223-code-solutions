## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
The condition determines when the loop will stop running. For a 'for' loop, the purpose of the condition is to allow us to repeatedly run some code until an expression returns false. A while loop repeats some code until its condition returns a false.

- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?
It is evaluated just before the loop is entered. It is usually used to declare a counter variable that will be used in the loop for instance i<10.

- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
The condition is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, then the body of the loop is continued to the next.

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
The value change is done after execution of certain statments in loop. The value keeps changing until the condition is fulfilled.
- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?
It is most often used to increment or decrement a value.
- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on?
A for loop is typically used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop.
